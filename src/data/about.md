# Intro

I'm a junior undergrad – Final year student at IITRAM, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and pursuing minors in Computer Science. I aspire to become a Software Engineer, not because it’s in vogue, but simply because I love the endless possibilities and novelties that this domain holds. A student at heart - continuously evolving and looking to learn new things.

If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.
